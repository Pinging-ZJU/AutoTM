# Experiment Documentation

## Benchmarker

Measure the general performance of AutoTM across varieties in PMM to DRAM ratios and between
the static, synchronous, and asynchronous formluations.

This folder holds the majority of the experiments for the ASPLOS 20 submission.

## Counters

Record hardware counter metrics for large workloads running in 1LM or 2LM modes.
Used to compare the differences between bandwidths in these two modes and to gain further
insight into the behavior of the 2LM cache.
